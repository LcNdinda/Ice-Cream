         Ice cream's origins are known to reach back as far as the second century B.C.,
         although no specific date of origin nor inventor has been undisputably credited with its discovery.
          We know that Alexander the Great enjoyed snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar.
          Biblical references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced drinks during harvesting.
           During the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius Caesar (A.D. 54-86) frequently sent runners into the mountains for snow,
           which was then flavored with fruits and juices.
