          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Frozen yogurt was introduced in New England in the 1970s as a soft serve dessert by H. P. Hood under the name Frogurt. In 1978, Brigham's, a Boston-based ice cream, candy and sandwich chain, developed and introduced the first packaged frozen
              yogurt under the name Humphreez Yogart. Around this same time, another packaged frozen yogurt product, called "Danny" debuted from Dannon. This variation was a raspberry yogurt product on a stick, and covered with dark chocolate. Both were
              originally intended as a healthier alternative to ice cream, but consumers complained about the tart taste and manufacturers began production of a recipe that contained more sugar. Frozen yogurt took off in the 1980s, reaching sales of $25
              million in 1986. In the early 1990s, frozen yogurt was 10% of the frozen dessert market.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Frozen yogurt usually consists of milk solids, some kind of sweetener, milk fat, yogurt culture, coloring, and flavoring.<br>Milk fat comprises about 0.5-6% of the yogurt. Added in quantities inversely proportional to the amount of milk solids,
              the milk fat lends richness to the yogurt. Milk solids account for 8-14% of the yogurt's volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting. Cane or beet sugar provides 15-17% of the yogurt's
              ingredients. In addition to adding sweetness, the sugar increases the volume of solid ingredients in the yogurt, improving body and texture. Animal gelatins and vegetable additives (guar gum, carrageenan, etc.) stabilize the yogurt, reducing
              crystallization and increasing the temperature at which the yogurt will melt. This stabilization ensures that the frozen yogurt maintains a smooth consistency regardless of handling or temperature change.<br>Frozen yogurt can be made in
              an ice cream machine; however, major companies often use assembly lines specifically dedicated to frozen yogurt production. The milk products and gelatin are combined and homogenized. At 32 °C, the yogurt culture is added. The mix remains
              at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling. After that, the mix is cooled to 0 to 4 °C. Once it has reached the desired temperature and viscosity, the yogurt is allowed to sit in aging tanks for up to four hours. Sweeteners,
              colorings and flavorings are then mixed in, and the yogurt mixture is cooled to -6 to -2 °C. To create extra volume and smooth consistency, air is incorporated into the yogurt as the mixture is agitated. When a sufficient amount of air has
              been incorporated into the product, the yogurt is rapidly frozen to prevent the formation of large ice crystals, and stored in a cold place to be shipped.</p>
